# java-snake-game
A simple snake game made with java swing and AWT API

1. This program uses awt's 'ActionListener' and 'KeyListener' packages to determine the position and how to move the snake.

2. We use awt's paint method to update the whole field for moving the snake and setting the apple

3. We included conditions such as if the snake hits the wall or collides with its own body a game over will show

4. For every apple that the snake eats, it will get longer and a score will be added

5. When the game is over, the score will be shown
